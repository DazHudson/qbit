** Qbit **

Qbit is a Java library for building micro services.

It uses Vertx, Netty and lots of other goodies.

There is a simple client and server. I have to admit its is very easy to put together,
although I am not getting anything like the number that are published by the author,
so I have pinged him to ask why.

# Running

`gradlew sandbox:qbit:qbitServer`
`gradlew sandbox:qbit:qbitClient`


See [this] (https://github.com/advantageous/qbit) for more information.

Its a real shame that this can't spin fast enough, because on paper it looks great.
